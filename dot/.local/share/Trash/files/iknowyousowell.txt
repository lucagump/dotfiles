I know you so well, so well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've been pretty patient, I've been pretty baby ohhh
Well I've been patient ohhhh
yeah...oh...oh

JOCELYN FLORES - LYRICS

I know you so well, so well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've been pretty

I know you so well, so well
I've been trapped in my mind girl, just holding on
I don't wanna pretend there's something, we're nothing
I've been stuck thinking 'bout her, I can't hold back

I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been tripped by some things I can't change
Suicidal, same time I maintain, fuck this thing
Get a phone call
Girl that you fuck with killed herself
How is it someone when nobody help
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fucking end it
Pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm digging
Having conversations about my haste decisions
Fucking sickening
At the same time, memory surfaced through the grapevine
But my uncle playing with a slipknot
Post traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since a couple months they had a nigga locked up

I be feeling pain, I be feeling pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
I be feeling pain, I be feeling pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb

I know you so well, I know you well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've been pretty
