Usage\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst commandJoin = require('command-join')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### `commandJoin(arg: Array|String): String`\r\n\r\nEscapes each command-line argument and joins them into a string that can then be executed, e.g. via `child_process.exec`.\r\n\r\nIf a string is passed, an array containing the string will instead be processed.\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nlet command = commandJoin(['a', \"b\\\\\", \"'c\"])\r\ncommand\r\n// output on Windows: a \"b\\\\\" 'c\r\n// output on Linux: a 'b\\' \\'c\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the tests for more convoluted examples.\r\n\r\n##
